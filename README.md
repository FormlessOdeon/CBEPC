Comic Book Price Calculator v0.1
Created in Python 3
THe purpose of this application is to take a specifically formatted excel file filled with comic books and get an average value from Ebay. 
It will accomplish this by making a pull from ebay for the last 5 sold items, average those 5 prices, and write those averages to the 
excel file. THe ebay pull will be performed in the Ebay API. The looping is done in python with the aid of the pandas lib. THe purpose of 
using pandas over simpler methods is the expandability offered by the pandas dataframe. 

As of 4/12/2017 the main functionality of this app is non-functioning.
